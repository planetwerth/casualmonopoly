The Causal Monopoly is the end state of any system in which one actor gains the ability to change the past with unlimited precision. Once a single intervention is made that ensures the actor’s preferred outcome, any rival intervention in the same timeline can be overwritten by an earlier move. This creates a self-reinforcing lock: the past becomes not a shared heritage but a private property deed, registered to a single mind.

The principle rests on the fact that causality is finite in structure. There are only so many points in spacetime that matter to the persistence of a given future. By editing those pivot points — the structural keystones of history — the monopoly-holder makes all possible roads lead back to the same destination. Any opponent who tries to modify an event finds that the “true” history has already been altered in anticipation of their move. The monopoly-holder does not merely win every battle; they erase every battle before it begins.

This produces an effect akin to a closed causal economy. Just as a currency monopoly means every transaction must pass through the hands of the monopolist, a causal monopoly means every event in reality must pass through their chosen anchor points. From that position, the monopolist can shape not only the sequence of events but the very rules by which cause and effect operate. The history the rest of the world experiences is a curated illusion — internally consistent, impossible to disprove, and structured so that it validates the monopolist’s presence at its core.

In practice, such control would manifest invisibly. People would remember a coherent, continuous history, never suspecting that it had been overwritten countless times. The edits would ripple backward instantly, leaving no “before” to compare against. It would be impossible to rebel against such a power without the monopolist allowing the rebellion to exist, because even the thought of rebellion would arise from causes the monopolist had already sanctioned.
